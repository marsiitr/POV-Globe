<h2> Abstract</h2>

The idea of this project is to make a **cool and unique 3D Spherical Display**.The team of 5 freshers did their best to make the spherical display, displaying the phenomenon of Persistence of Vision using a ring rotating at a very high rpm with a LED strip on its circumference which was adjusted to glow so as to make the model capable of displaying floating text, user enter words and blurred images.  


<h2> Motivation</h2>

The main driving force about this project was that it was different than the core models with moving servo motors, controlled by programs, it was cool, has a colorful look and is a bit unique.


<h2> Mechanical Sructure</h2>

It consists of a ring (which we made out of a badminton racket) mounted on a heavy cardboard(to decrease the vibrations of rotating ring), it also consisted of a slip ring(self made using an stainless steel cylinder, copper wires and rubber bands!!).

<h2> Electronic Component Used</h2>

1. Arduino UNO
2. Cytron Motor Driver
3. Hall Sensor
4. High Torque Bane-Bot 18W DC Motor 
5. Adressable -RGB LED strip(60LEDs/m)(20 LEDs on the semicirle


<h2> Working</h2>

**Principle** The Persistence Of Vision phenomenon
- The ring with LEDs mounted on it was rotated at around 1500 rpm  so as to give effect of 25fps display.
- The feedback for the completion of a revolution was taken using hall sensor mounted on the side.
- According to the feedback from hall sensor, angular velocity and time period of every revolution was calculated.
- Dividing the revolution time into various segments, the LEDs were lighted according to the printed text.
- The whole system was powered by 12V LiPo battery and power was transmitted to LEDs using slip ring.

<h2> Cost Structure</h2>


| Item | Cost(â‚¹) |
| :--- | :--- |
| LED strip | 2k |
| Bane Bot 18V DC motor | 15k |
| The arduino UNO | 400|
| Cytron Motor Driver | 1k |
| The hall Sensor,wires,voltage regulator etc.(other electronics) | 800 |
|**Total**| 19.2 k| 
Overall it was descent for its cost.

<h2> Limitations</h2>

 - At present we are able to diaplay 4-5 alphabets since the adrduino UNO clock has least delay of 1ms, the individual vertical strips expanded due to a large time difference between them, which made the letters wide. 
 - At present ,if we try to show some images ,they appear distorted due to the above limitation and the unavailability of higher density LED strip.
 - The present slip ring isn't that efficient in, it when operated at angular velocity higher than 1500 rpm,it starts to show noise in the data cable, making the display bad.


<h2> Future Improvements</h2>

 - To increase the number of alphabets covered.
 - To display images and if more advanced ,videos.
