This is the folder to contain the codes that we run while ooperating on the machine during Srishti 2019.
A brief overview-
1. Display_(something) is used to display that something on the machine.
2. Display_name is the code used to display any name as said by user just by invoking the appropriate functions in reverse order(since the bot was designed to rotate clockwise and the code was running anticlockwise).
3.LED_test was used to test the Led Strip without using motor.
